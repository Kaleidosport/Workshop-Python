## A foreword  
> Why would you learn Python?  
    
Surely you've already become aware of it in the wake of our web development's bootcamp: **Python**'s the current go-to-guy when it comes to programming. Should one learn but one programming language throughout his or her life, **Python** would be the üí° wisest choice aside from personal tastes. All the more if said person's into softwares or data analysis.  
  
Furthermore, though they don't compete on equal footing with the JS big three (React, Angular & Vue), top-tier **Python** frameworks rank high among the most in-demand üìä web development techs. So, basically, one can't go wrong with **Python**. See for yourself hereunder. Still skeptical about our sneaky snake pal? Well, we've got about 3 more hours to get you hooked... :wink:

<h4>Installing Python</h4>      

üìå [Click here to access Python's official download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)  

```
Since you're all using Windows (ignore the crowd booing in the background), 
all you've got to do is install Python 3.10.
The drills and activities we'll be sharing rely on that version, which is the latest.
Once Python 3.10 is installed, you can add the extensions Python and Pylance on VsCode. 
If you're in trouble, contact someone from our team. We'll help you asap.
```  

<h4>Components and dependencies</h4>  

As teased previously, we'll be skimming through a handful of tools pertaining to Python's galaxy. To make sure y'all can be up to the task as soon as the workshop gets started, you'll need to proceed as per the following instructions. Don't worry, that's kinda similar to what you've encountered on React, NodeJs and NPM.                 

üìå First of all, check whether or not **pip**'s installed  

```
In your terminal:
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
This invocation will install or upgrade pip if need be.
```  
  
üìå Once **pip**'s been taken care of, add the following:  
  
```
pip install pyramid
pip install Flask
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```  

One thing leading to another, you already got a small preview of the techs you'll be using during the workshop. Since curiosity's a great quality as long as it's paired up with proactivity, feel free to look into those ahead of D-day. As usual, reach up to us in case you've got questions or if an issue arises amidst the aforementioned process.  

Lookin' forward to diggin' deeper on Thursday! :eyes:
